Caupona is a companion for cantines of the Studentenwerk Berlin. 

## Roadmap/Purpose

I maintain this project as a study repo for a webapp with Node.js/Vue based frontend powered by firebase hosting, auth and realtime database. This project wil eventually be updated to Vue 3 once Vuetify and Vuefire release Vue 3 support.
